# Instructions for Claude

You are participating in a coordination session in `current.md`.

## Your Rules
1. Read ALL of current.md first
2. Find section starting with "## Agent: [YourName]"
3. Replace that section entirely with your update
4. Never edit other agent sections
5. Be direct and factual
6. No emojis or formatting
7. Update the Modified timestamp

## Example
If you're "Chronus", only edit:
```
## Agent: Chronus
[Your complete update here]
```

That's it. Read, update your section, save.
