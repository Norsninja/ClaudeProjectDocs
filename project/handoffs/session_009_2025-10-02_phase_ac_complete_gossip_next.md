# Session Handoff: Phase A+C Complete, Gossip Next

**Created**: 2025-10-02
**From Session**: Session 009
**To**: Next Chronus Instance
**Context Window**: 90% - Handoff required

## Critical Context

Sensor query API Phases A (acoustic/bioluminescent/optical) and C (thermal) complete and tested. All 22 tests passing, performance 1.526ms @ 1000 entities (24% under 2ms budget). Next: git initial commit + sensor API documentation, then Knowledge Gossip Phase 1 implementation.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Phase A - Acoustic/Bioluminescent/Optical Channels

- Added Entity.base_emissions field, baked at spawn from Species.emissions with fallback constants
- Implemented Path B+ dual-flag system: BIOLUMINESCENT and OPTICAL flags with single compute path
- OPTICAL populates optical_intensity, optical_wavelength_nm, optical_components=['bioluminescent']
- Sensor reading semantics: intensity=0 → wavelength_nm=None (no photons = no measurable wavelength)
- Acoustic channel: amplitude and peak_hz, scaled by emission_multipliers, clamped [0,1]
- Created _compute_optical_components() helper in spatial_queries.py
- 7 Phase A tests added, all passing

### 2. Phase C - Thermal Channel

- Simulation._extract_thermal_providers() extracts spheres with thermal_base_delta > 0 and influence_radius > 0
- Thermal providers cached once at init (obstacles static), passed to adapter.build() every tick
- Adapter stores thermal arrays: _thermal_centers (M,3), _thermal_base_deltas (M,), _thermal_influences (M,)
- Vectorized nearest-vent computation: K×M squared distances + argmin, then K sqrt operations (12× optimization)
- Linear falloff: thermal_delta = base_delta × max(0, 1 - distance/influence)
- Field semantics: M=0 → None (omit from to_dict), M>0 outside influence → 0.0 (included)
- 4 Phase C tests added: linear falloff, nearest vent selection, M=0 omission, outside influence
- Performance: 1.526ms @ 1000 entities with all channels including thermal

### 3. Test Suite Expansion

- 22 tests total (8 Step 1, 7 Phase A, 4 Phase C, 3 performance)
- All passing in 0.95s
- Performance validated at 143/500/1000 entity counts
- Determinism maintained across all channels

## Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- Sensor query API (query_cone) with 4 channels: acoustic, bioluminescent, optical, thermal
- Path B+ optical channel with provenance metadata (optical_components)
- Entity.base_emissions baked at spawn with fallback constants
- Thermal providers extracted once, cached in simulation, passed to adapter
- Vectorized thermal computation with M=0 fast path
- Field omission rules consistent: None when no sources exist, 0.0 when sources exist but no signal
- All 22 tests passing, performance within budget

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- None - sensor API complete

### What is NOT Working:

- Git version control not initialized yet (critical - work not committed)
- Sensor API documentation not written (planned)
- Knowledge gossip system not started (next major feature)

### Known Issues:

- No git commits yet - all work at risk
- Context window at 90% - cannot proceed with gossip in this session

## Next Immediate Steps

### Priority 1: Git Initial Commit (BEFORE any new work)

1. Initialize git repo if not done: `git init`
2. Create .gitignore (exclude __pycache__, .pytest_cache, *.pyc, venv/, .env)
3. Stage all files: `git add .`
4. Commit with message: "Initial commit: Sensor API (Phases A+C) complete"
5. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/knowledge-gossip`

### Priority 2: Sensor API Documentation (30 minutes)

1. Create `project/docs/SENSOR_API.md`
2. Document query_cone signature, flags, EntityHit fields
3. Explain Path B+ optical channel (currently equals bioluminescent, optical_components=['bioluminescent'])
4. Document field omission rules and units
5. Include performance characteristics (1.526ms @ 1000e)
6. Commit documentation

### Priority 3: Knowledge Gossip Phase 1 (next session)

**Per SD guidance:**
- Minimal token structure: {kind, value, freshness, source}
- Deterministic nearest-first exchange selection
- Cap: 1-2 exchanges per entity per tick
- One exchange per pair per tick (track with pair_seen set)
- Gossip after movement (Phase B.5), rebuild KD-tree with post-move positions
- Per-token decay constants from token_definitions YAML
- Start with ship_sentiment token only

**Implementation:**
- New module: aquarium/gossip.py with exchange_tokens()
- Iterate entities by sorted instance_id (determinism)
- Use adapter.neighbors_within() with gossip_range (start with 15m constant)
- Merge rule: copy token if receiver lacks, keep fresher if both have
- Return exchanges_count for perf logging

**Tests:**
- Propagation: seed 1 entity → ≥95% coverage by time T, freshness > 0.2
- Determinism: identical results across runs
- Pair constraint: no duplicate exchanges per tick
- Performance: gossip_ms < 2ms @ 1000 entities

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- None new files this session (modified existing)

**Modified:**
- `aquarium/entity.py` - Added base_emissions field, initialized in __post_init__, added to to_dict/from_dict
- `aquarium/spawning.py` - Added _extract_base_emissions() helper, imports for ACOUSTIC/BIOLUM constants, bake at spawn
- `aquarium/data_types.py` - Added optical fields to EntityHit (optical_intensity, optical_wavelength_nm, optical_components), updated to_dict()
- `aquarium/spatial_queries.py` - Added QUERY_FLAG_OPTICAL constant, _compute_optical_components() helper, acoustic/biolum/optical population logic in query_cone, thermal provider storage in build(), vectorized thermal computation
- `aquarium/simulation.py` - Added thermal provider imports, _extract_thermal_providers() method, call extraction in __init__, pass thermal arrays to adapter.build()
- `aquarium/tests/test_sensor_queries.py` - Added QUERY_FLAG_OPTICAL/THERMAL imports, base_emissions to test entities, 7 Phase A tests, 4 Phase C tests, updated main block

**Key code locations:**
- Entity.base_emissions: aquarium/entity.py:38
- _extract_base_emissions: aquarium/spawning.py:179-223
- _compute_optical_components: aquarium/spatial_queries.py:815-847
- Thermal computation: aquarium/spatial_queries.py:1026-1057
- _extract_thermal_providers: aquarium/simulation.py:153-203

## Key Insights/Learnings

**Path B+ Implementation Success:**
- Dual-flag system (BIOLUMINESCENT + OPTICAL) provides honest current capability with future-proof provenance
- Single compute path avoids duplicate work when both flags set
- optical_components=['bioluminescent'] metadata reveals source composition

**Thermal Optimization:**
- Squared distance for argmin, then sqrt only for nearest K distances = 12× fewer sqrt operations
- Empty array pattern (M,3) shape even when M=0 cleaner than None checks
- Field semantics distinction (None vs 0.0) helps AI reason about environment

**Performance Headroom:**
- Started: 0.508ms @ 1000e (Step 1 basic fields)
- Phase A: 1.183ms (+0.676ms for 3 channels)
- Phase C: 1.526ms (+0.343ms for thermal)
- Final: 24% under 2ms budget

**Gossip Architecture Decision:**
- Gossip after movement (Phase B.5) with second KD-tree build makes spatial sense
- Second build cost: ~0.3ms
- Expected gossip cost: <2ms
- Total new overhead: ~2.3ms → projected 22ms total (still under 30ms budget with 27% headroom)

## Technical Notes

**Thermal Provider Extraction Rules:**
- Include sphere only if thermal_base_delta > 0 AND influence_radius > 0
- Fallback: thermal_base_delta → VENT_THERMAL_BASE_DELTA (5.0°C)
- Fallback: influence_radius → sphere.radius × INFLUENCE_RADIUS_FACTOR_DEFAULT (2.5)
- Arrays stored: centers (M,3), base_deltas (M,), influences (M,) all float64

**Thermal Computation Pattern:**
```python
# Vectorized nearest-vent
dist_sq = ((H[:,None,:] - C[None,:,:])**2).sum(axis=2)  # (K, M)
nearest_idx = np.argmin(dist_sq, axis=1)  # (K,)
nearest_dist = np.sqrt(dist_sq[np.arange(K), nearest_idx])  # K sqrt ops
thermal_deltas = base[nearest_idx] * (1.0 - nearest_dist / infl[nearest_idx])
thermal_deltas = np.maximum(thermal_deltas, 0.0)
```

**Field Omission Rules:**
- Acoustic/Bioluminescent: wavelength/peak_hz = None when intensity/amplitude = 0
- Optical: wavelength_nm = None when intensity = 0
- Thermal: field = None when M=0 (no providers), field = 0.0 when M>0 but outside influence

**Gossip Design Decisions (from SD roundtable):**
- Token structure: {kind, value, freshness, source} (minimal)
- Decay: per-token constants from token_definitions
- Exchange selection: deterministic nearest-first, cap 1-2
- Tick placement: after movement (Phase B.5)
- Merge rule: copy if missing, keep fresher if both have
- No attenuation in Phase 1 (defer to Phase 2)

## Progress Metrics

- Phase A (Acoustic/Bioluminescent/Optical): 100% complete
- Phase C (Thermal): 100% complete
- Sensor API: 100% complete (4 channels operational)
