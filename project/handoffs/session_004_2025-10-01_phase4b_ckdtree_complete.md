# Session Handoff: Phase 4b cKDTree Integration Complete

**Created**: 2025-10-01
**From Session**: Session 004
**To**: Next Chronus Instance
**Context Window**: 64% - Ready for handoff

## Critical Context

Phase 4b cKDTree integration is complete and validated. All infrastructure works correctly with 1.07x speedup at 1000 entities. Next session must implement batch APIs to unlock 2-4x performance gains required for moon-scale ecosystem (5000+ entities).

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Phase 4b: cKDTree Infrastructure Integration

- Added capacity management with amortized 2x growth (simulation.py:150-171)
- Implemented fast-path adapter.build(positions_array, refs) for prebuilt positions
- Integrated spatial adapter into simulation.tick() Phase A (builds once per tick from t=N snapshot)
- Updated behavior.py to receive and use adapter instance instead of module functions
- Added timing breakdown: build_ms, behavior_ms, movement_ms tracked separately
- Fixed critical bug in cKDTree iterative k-nearest query (while True loop, not while k <= max_k)

### 2. Performance Validation & Testing

- Created A/B comparison test at multiple scales (100, 500, 1000 entities)
- Validated determinism: 0.000000000000m position difference between O(n) and cKDTree
- Measured performance crossover point: ~750 entities where cKDTree becomes faster
- Results: 100e (0.92x), 500e (0.99x), 1000e (1.07x - cKDTree wins)
- All behavior tests passing (5/5 including multiple predators test)

### 3. Game Vision Documentation

- Updated GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md with narrative layer (ancient civilization, AI sovereignty endgame)
- Updated AQUARIUM_SIMULATION.md with food web architecture (plankton→herbivore→predator)
- Documented extended phase roadmap (Phases 7-14: energy, population, gradients, ship, moon, rendering, narrative, AI reflection)
- Established core principle: stable ecosystem first, then ship integration

## Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- cKDTree spatial indexing with O(log N) queries (validated at 1000 entities)
- Two-phase tick contract (Phase A: build index once, Phase B: movement)
- Position array preallocation with amortized growth
- Fast-path adapter.build() using numpy arrays
- Deterministic tie-breaking (distance, instance_id)
- All Phase 3 behavior tests (flee, investigate, multiple predators)
- A/B determinism tests (O(n) vs cKDTree produce identical results)

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- Performance at 1000 entities (1.07x speedup) - validates approach but leaves gains on table
- Current implementation makes N separate adapter calls per tick (Python overhead dominates)
- Tag filtering happens in Python loops after spatial query (inefficient)

### What is NOT Working:

- None - all functionality correct, just not optimal performance yet

### Known Issues:

- No performance gain below ~750 entities (expected - overhead dominates at small N)
- Batch APIs needed to unlock 2-4x gains (current 1.07x insufficient for moon scale)

## Next Immediate Steps

### Priority 1: Implement Batch Query APIs (Session 005)

Per SD's detailed guidance:

**Step 1: Add Batch Methods to SpatialIndexAdapter**
- `nearest_by_tag_batch(sources: np.ndarray, tag: str, max_distance: Optional[float]) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]`
- `neighbors_within_batch(sources: np.ndarray, radius: float, tag_filter: Optional[Set[str]]) -> List[np.ndarray]`
- Use `query_ball_point(sources, r=max_distance, workers=-1)` for bounded searches
- Return indices[i] = -1, distances[i] = np.inf when no match

**Step 2: Stable Index Mapping**
- Maintain `self._row_of_id[entity_id]` and `self._id_of_row[row]` mappings
- Adapter returns row indices (relative to positions array)
- Behavior reads via row index → entity id lookup

**Step 3: Tag Masks & Biome Grouping**
- Precompute boolean masks: `mask_predator[row]`, `mask_ship[row]`
- Group sources by biome, run batch per group (reduces filtering overhead)
- Filter candidate arrays with masks before distance sort

**Step 4: Query Cache Integration**
- Cache shape: `cache['nearest_predator'][row] = (dist, nearest_row)`
- Build in tick Phase A after spatial index
- Behavior engine reads from cache (avoids per-entity adapter calls)

**Step 5: Testing & Validation**
- A/B tests at 100/1000/5000 entities (O(n) vs cKDTree vs cKDTree+batch)
- Assert bit-for-bit determinism (positions and behavior IDs)
- Measure breakdown: build_ms, batch_query_ms, behavior_ms, movement_ms
- Multi-biome test (250+250 entities)

**Success Criteria:**
- 1000 entities: <3ms per tick (currently 6ms)
- 5000 entities: <10ms per tick
- All tests pass, determinism preserved

**Optional (if needed):**
- Per-tag subtrees for 'predator' and 'ship' (build 2-3 small trees per tick)
- Only add if batch APIs don't hit targets

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `aquarium/tests/test_ab_comparison.py` - A/B determinism test (O(n) vs cKDTree at 100/500/1000 entities)

**Modified:**
- `aquarium/simulation.py` - Added capacity management, spatial adapter integration, timing breakdown
- `aquarium/spatial_queries.py` - Enhanced build() for fast path, fixed iterative k-nearest bug
- `aquarium/behavior.py` - Updated all functions to receive spatial adapter instance
- `aquarium/constants.py` - Added USE_CKDTREE, CKDTREE_LEAFSIZE
- `project/GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` - Added "The Mystery (Narrative Layer)" section
- `project/AQUARIUM_SIMULATION.md` - Added "Ecosystem Vision" section with Phases 7-14

## Key Insights/Learnings

**Performance Crossover Point:**
- Below 750 entities: O(n) faster (overhead dominates)
- Above 750 entities: cKDTree wins (spatial acceleration outweighs overhead)
- 1.07x speedup at 1000 entities validates infrastructure but requires batch APIs for moon scale

**Why Batch APIs Are Critical:**
- Current: 1000 separate adapter calls per tick (1000 entities × 1 call each)
- With batching: 2 batch calls per tick (one for 'nearest_predator', one for 'nearest_ship')
- Expected: 2-4x improvement from eliminating Python call overhead

**Critical Bug Fixed:**
- Original: `while k <= max_k` (fails when k=8 > max_k=2, never enters loop)
- Fixed: `while True` with `if actual_k >= max_k: break` (always queries at least once)
- Test 5 (multiple predators) caught this - perfect nearest selection now works

**Ecosystem Vision Clarity:**
- Ship is an entity IN the simulation, not observer outside it
- Aquarium must be stable/self-sustaining before ship integration
- Food web (plankton→herbivore→predator) drives all future development
- Narrative injected procedurally after ecosystem proven

## Technical Notes

**SD's Batch API Refinements (Critical for Next Session):**

1. **Self-exclusion**: Batch queries must exclude source row (distance 0)
2. **Biome handling**: Group sources by biome, run batch per group OR pass biome_id array and filter
3. **Tag filtering**: Use precomputed masks, not Python loops
4. **Nearest strategy**: `query_ball_point` for bounded, avoid k-doubling
5. **Workers**: `workers=-1` OK, but MUST sort by (distance, instance_id) for determinism
6. **Return convention**: indices[i]=-1, distances[i]=inf when no match
7. **Cache key**: Use row indices, not entity objects

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
- Empty tags (zero predators/ships) - return all -1/inf quickly
- Multi-biome - filter cross-biome candidates
- Dense neighbor sets - consider caps if needed (unlikely at current scale)

**Two-Phase Tick Invariant (DO NOT BREAK):**
- Phase A: Build index ONCE from t=N snapshot, evaluate behaviors, update velocities
- Phase B: Update positions, apply bounds reflection
- NO tree rebuild during or after Phase B
- All behaviors see consistent world state at t=N

## Progress Metrics

- Phase 4b Progress: 100% (cKDTree integration complete)
- Tests Passing: 8/8 (5 behavior + 3 A/B comparison)
- Performance: 1.07x at 1000 entities (validates approach, batch APIs needed)
- Context Window at Handoff: 64%
