# Session Handoff: Gossip Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Designed

**Created**: 2025-10-02
**From Session**: 012
**To**: Next Chronus Instance
**Context Window**: 59% (106k/200k)

## Critical Context

Knowledge gossip Phase 1 complete and merged to main with tag c5. Algorithm v2 (radius push-pull, SoA cache) achieves p50 1.6ms @ 1000 entities. Phase 2 lifecycle (decay/eviction/reliability) fully designed and documented, ready for implementation.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Gossip Phase 1 Optimization & Merge

- Implemented uniform-range fast path: cached per-row ranges by adapter._build_seq, eliminated grouping loop (~0.3ms improvement)
- Implemented SoA token state cache: cached has/val/version/last_tick arrays, eliminated per-tick entity loop (~0.55ms improvement)
- Added generic SpatialIndexAdapter._build_seq counter for cache invalidation
- Final performance: p50 1.6ms, profiled 1.29ms (35% under 2ms budget)
- All 5 tests passing consistently (propagation, determinism, pair constraint, performance, version precedence)

### 2. Merge to Main & Milestone

- Merged feature/knowledge-gossip to main with --no-ff (4 commits: baseline + 2 optimizations + docs)
- Tagged milestone c5 (Checkpoint C5: Knowledge Gossip Phase 1 Complete)
- Updated PROGRESS.md with final metrics and C5 completion
- Updated session_011 handoff with optimization details

### 3. Phase 2 Lifecycle Design

- Created comprehensive design doc: project/plans/gossip_phase2_lifecycle_design.md
- Specified exponential decay math: freshness = exp(-rate * age), reliability = exp(-rel_rate * age)
- Defined capacity enforcement (cap=16 default) with deterministic eviction (freshness → reliability → last_tick)
- Designed reliability channel: added to schema, attenuates during propagation, used for merge tiebreaks
- Answered all open questions with SD: raw freshness (no normalization), during-merge attenuation, per-kind rates, SoA cache includes reliability
- Defined testing strategy: test_gossip_lifecycle.py with 6 test cases
- Updated PROGRESS.md with Phase 2 as next priority

## Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- Gossip Phase 1: radius-based push-pull, version+timestamp, SoA cache, uniform-range fast path
- Performance: p50 1.6ms, profiled 1.29ms @ 1000 entities (5/5 tests passing)
- Cache architecture: generation-based invalidation via adapter._build_seq, zero Python loops on steady state
- Integration: simulation.py Phase B.5 with timing tracking
- Documentation: design docs, research validation, PROGRESS.md, git tagged c5

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- None (Phase 1 complete)

### What is NOT Working:

- None (Phase 1 complete)

### Known Issues:

- None (all issues from session 011 resolved)

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement Gossip Phase 2 Lifecycle**
   - Follow design spec in project/plans/gossip_phase2_lifecycle_design.md
   - Extend token schema: add reliability field
   - Update SoA cache: add reliability array
   - Implement exponential decay: freshness/reliability computed from last_tick
   - Implement capacity enforcement: evict when count > cap, deterministic ordering
   - Implement attenuation: reliability *= (1 - attenuation) during gossip merge
   - Create test_gossip_lifecycle.py with 6 test cases
   - Maintain performance target: p50 < 2ms @ 1000 entities

2. **Extend Tokens YAML Schema**
   - Add decay.freshness_rate, decay.reliability_rate, decay.eviction_threshold
   - Add gossip.attenuation
   - Add merge.algorithm, merge.weight_freshness
   - Add initial_values.reliability

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Verify lifecycle determinism (tick-based, not wall-clock)
   - Verify ≥95% propagation coverage maintained
   - Verify performance budget maintained (p50 < 2ms)
   - Update existing tests for reliability field

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

- `project/plans/gossip_phase2_lifecycle_design.md` - Complete Phase 2 specification (decay, eviction, reliability, attenuation)
- `project/handoffs/session_012_2025-10-02_gossip_phase1_complete.md` - This handoff

**Modified:**

- `aquarium/gossip.py` - Added uniform-range fast path (cached ranges), SoA token state cache (cached arrays)
- `aquarium/spatial_queries.py` - Added _build_seq counter, incremented on build()
- `project/status/PROGRESS.md` - Updated with C5 completion, Phase 2 next steps
- `project/handoffs/session_011_2025-10-02_gossip_v2_integration.md` - Appended optimization results

**Merged to main:**

- Commit 1ff176d: feat(gossip): knowledge gossip v2 baseline
- Commit 7f1edc8: perf(gossip): uniform-range fast path
- Commit e73956a: perf(gossip): SoA token state cache
- Commit eec8aac: docs(gossip): handoff and PROGRESS updates
- Merge commit 5fc9b6f: feature/knowledge-gossip → main
- Tag c5: Checkpoint C5 complete

**Committed to main post-merge:**

- Commit d84f8ae: docs(gossip): Phase 2 lifecycle design + PROGRESS update

## Key Insights/Learnings

- Uniform-range fast path highly effective when all entities use same gossip_range_m (15m fallback)
- SoA cache eliminates 0.95ms Python loop, provides 0.55ms net improvement
- Generation-based cache invalidation (adapter._build_seq) is clean and bulletproof
- Test variance (1.5-2.2ms) eliminated by GC disable + BLAS threading control (OPENBLAS/MKL/NUMEXPR/OMP_NUM_THREADS=1)
- Exponential decay superior to linear (bounded [0,1], naturalistic, vectorizable)
- Raw freshness values correct for eviction (no normalization across kinds with different decay rates)

## Technical Notes

- Constants.CKDTREE_WORKERS = 1 (single-threaded 1.86x faster than -1 for gossip)
- Test harness: warmup + GC disable + 7 runs + perf_counter_ns + p50/p90 reporting
- Profiling: GOSSIP_PROFILE=1 enables sub-timers (extract/edge_query/merge/writeback)
- Cache keys: id(adapter) → {build_seq, N, arrays} (range cache + token state cache)
- Phase 2 estimated time: ~5 hours (design complete, implementation straightforward)

## Progress Metrics

- Phase 1 Gossip: 100% complete
- Checkpoint C5: Complete
- Tests Passing: 5/5
- Performance: p50 1.6ms (20% under 2.2ms threshold, 35% under 2ms budget)
- Context Window at Handoff: 59%
