# Session Handoff: Gossip Vectorized, Near Budget

**Created**: 2025-10-02
**From Session**: Session 010
**To**: Next Chronus Instance
**Context Window**: 89% - Handoff required

## Critical Context

Knowledge gossip Phase 1 implemented with fully vectorized array-based merge. Performance 2.6ms @ 1000 entities (31% over 2ms budget but 95% improvement from initial 58ms). Git initialized with 9 backfill commits. Three test failures need fixes before integration: propagation logic bug, float precision issue, performance squeeze to <2ms.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Git Repository Initialization

- Initialized git repo on branch main with origin
- Created .gitignore (Python, OS, editors, AI configs)
- 9 atomic backfill commits documenting development phases:
  1. chore(git): .gitignore and workflow docs
  2. docs(project): README and design documentation
  3. feat(sim): minimal tick + behavior engine
  4. perf(spatial): cKDTree adapter + batch queries
  5. perf(avoidance): spatial hash + obstacle-centric
  6. feat(sensors): cone query API with 4 channels complete
  7. docs(handoffs): session continuity 007-009
  8. docs(status): progress tracking and research
  9. docs(sensors): comprehensive sensor API documentation
- Created milestone tags: c1-spatial-batch, c2-avoidance, c4b-thermal, session-2025-10-02-sensors-complete
- Feature branch created: feature/knowledge-gossip

### 2. Knowledge Gossip System Implementation

- Created aquarium/gossip.py with exchange_tokens() function
- Implemented vectorized k-NN approach using cKDTree.query()
- Array-based token state (has, val, fresh) with vectorized merge operations
- Per-species gossip_range_m support with fallback to 15m constant
- Deterministic nearest-first selection with cap=2
- Attenuation support from token_definitions.yaml (Phase 1: 0.1 for ship_sentiment)

### 3. Performance Optimization Journey

- Initial implementation: 58ms @ 1000 entities (per-entity KD-tree calls)
- After batched query_pairs: 31ms (eliminated per-entity queries)
- After k-NN with structured sort: 14ms (eliminated query_pairs overhead)
- After vectorized merge: 2.6ms (eliminated 1255 Python function calls)
- Performance improvement: 95% reduction (58ms → 2.6ms)

### 4. Constants and Configuration

- Added to constants.py:
  - GOSSIP_EXCHANGES_PER_ENTITY = 2
  - GOSSIP_FALLBACK_RANGE_M = 15.0
  - GOSSIP_ALLOWED_KINDS = ['ship_sentiment']
  - USE_GOSSIP = True

### 5. Test Suite Creation

- Created aquarium/tests/test_gossip.py with 5 tests:
  - test_propagation (coverage validation)
  - test_determinism (reproducibility)
  - test_pair_constraint (deduplication)
  - test_performance (budget compliance)
  - test_freshness_comparison (merge logic)
- Created profiling test (test_gossip_profile.py) for detailed timing analysis

## Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- Git repository with complete commit history and milestone tags
- Sensor API (Phases A+C) with 22 tests passing, 1.526ms @ 1000 entities
- Gossip vectorized k-NN pair generation (fast, deterministic)
- Gossip array-based state extraction (has, val, fresh)
- Gossip pair deduplication using int64 keys
- Test: test_determinism (PASSING)
- Test: test_pair_constraint (PASSING)

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- Gossip performance: 2.6ms @ 1000 entities (target <2ms, 31% over budget)
- Gossip vectorized merge logic exists but has propagation bug

### What is NOT Working:

- Test: test_propagation (10% coverage vs 95% target, exchanges stall at tick 5)
- Test: test_performance (2.6ms vs 2ms budget)
- Test: test_freshness_comparison (float32 precision issue, expected 1e-9 but got 1e-8)
- Gossip not integrated into simulation.py Phase B.5 yet
- No gossip instrumentation in simulation tick logging

### Known Issues:

- Propagation bug: Vectorized merge mask logic causes exchanges to stall after initial spread. Coverage reaches only 10/100 entities and stops growing. Likely issue: after first exchange, both entities have equal freshness so mask becomes false. Need to debug mask_fwd and mask_rev logic in lines 216-217 of gossip.py.
- Float precision: Using np.float32 for token values causes precision loss. Test expects 1e-9 tolerance but gets 1e-8 error. Fix: change val array to np.float64 (line 116 gossip.py).
- Performance 31% over budget: Main remaining costs are position extraction (~0.4ms) and KD-tree builds per range group (~0.2ms each). May need to cache positions or accept 2.6ms as acceptable for Phase 1.

## Next Immediate Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Propagation Bug (CRITICAL)

1. Debug vectorized merge mask logic in aquarium/gossip.py lines 216-217
2. Issue: mask_fwd = src_has & (~dst_has | (src_fresh > dst_fresh))
   - After first exchange, src and dst have equal freshness (attenuation=0.1, but both ~0.9)
   - Freshness comparison becomes false, blocking further spread
3. Possible fix: Use >= instead of > for freshness comparison, or adjust logic to allow re-transmission
4. Test: Run test_propagation to verify ≥95% coverage

### Priority 2: Fix Float Precision

1. Change val array from np.float32 to np.float64 (line 116 gossip.py)
2. Test: Run test_freshness_comparison to verify precision

### Priority 3: Performance Optimization (Optional)

1. Profile remaining 0.6ms overhead (2.6ms - 2.0ms target)
2. Options:
   - Cache positions array in adapter (avoid extraction)
   - Accept 2.6ms as good enough for Phase 1
   - Optimize KD-tree builds (currently ~0.2ms per range group)

### Priority 4: Integration and Commit

1. Fix above bugs first
2. Integrate gossip into simulation.py Phase B.5:
   - Add gossip call after movement phase
   - Rebuild KD-tree with post-move positions
   - Add gossip_ms and exchanges_count to perf logging
3. Run full simulation test with gossip enabled
4. Update PROGRESS.md with gossip status
5. Commit Phase 1: Knowledge Gossip Exchange to feature branch
6. Merge to main if all tests pass

## Key Insights/Learnings

**Vectorization Strategy Success:**
Array-based token state (has, val, fresh) with vectorized merge operations eliminated 1255 Python function calls per tick, reducing gossip time from 14ms to 2.6ms. This approach scales well and leaves room for multiple token kinds in Phase 2.

**Performance Breakdown @ 1000 entities:**
- Position extraction: ~0.4ms
- Range grouping: ~0.1ms
- KD-tree build (per group): ~0.2ms
- k-NN query: ~0.5ms
- Pair deduplication: ~0.3ms
- Vectorized merge: ~0.1ms
- Write-back to entities: ~1.0ms (changed rows only)
- Total: 2.6ms

**Propagation Stall Root Cause:**
Vectorized merge uses > for freshness comparison. After first exchange with attenuation=0.1, both entities have freshness ~0.9 (equal within floating point precision), so subsequent exchanges are blocked. Need to allow re-transmission or adjust comparison logic.

**Git Strategy:**
Atomic commits by domain (git, docs, sim, spatial, avoidance, sensors) provide clean rollback points and clear history. Milestone tags capture performance baselines for future comparison.

## Technical Notes

**Gossip Algorithm (gossip.py exchange_tokens):**

1. Extract token state to arrays:
   ```python
   has = np.zeros(N, dtype=bool)
   val = np.zeros(N, dtype=np.float32)  # BUG: should be float64
   fresh = np.zeros(N, dtype=np.float32)
   ```

2. Group by gossip_range_m, run k-NN per group:
   ```python
   k = min(cap_per_entity + 1, len(R))
   dists, nidx = tree_R.query(group_positions, k=k)
   ```

3. Canonicalize and deduplicate pairs using int64 keys:
   ```python
   pair_keys = a.astype(np.int64) * N + b.astype(np.int64)
   unique_keys, unique_idx = np.unique(pair_keys, return_index=True)
   ```

4. Vectorized merge with direction masks:
   ```python
   mask_fwd = src_has & (~dst_has | (src_fresh > dst_fresh))  # BUG: > blocks equal
   mask_rev = dst_has & (~src_has | (dst_fresh > src_fresh))
   ```

5. Apply transfers and write back changed rows only

**Debug Strategy for Propagation:**
Add print statements in gossip.py after mask computation to see:
- How many mask_fwd and mask_rev are True each tick
- Freshness values of src and dst pairs
- Why exchanges stop after tick 5

**Performance Optimization Options:**
- Cache positions in adapter._positions during build() (saves 0.4ms)
- Build single KD-tree for all ranges, filter by distance (avoid per-group builds)
- Accept 2.6ms as acceptable (still 8× faster than sensor queries at 1.5ms)

## Progress Metrics

- Gossip implementation: 100% complete (with bugs)
- Gossip tests: 2/5 passing (determinism, pair_constraint)
- Gossip performance: 2.6ms @ 1000 entities (target <2ms, 31% over)
