# Session Handoff: C7 Phase 2 Complete, Phase 3 Specified

**Created**: 2025-10-03
**From Session**: 014
**To**: Next Chronus Instance
**Context Window**: 67% - Ready for handoff

## Critical Context

C7 Phase 1 and Phase 2 complete. Multi-kind infrastructure ready with per-kind SoA cache, edge reuse, and cache cleanup. Phase 3 test specification written (6 tests, TDD approach). Next session: implement tests, verify they fail, then implement Phase 4 (most_recent + position handling + enable predator_location).

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. C7 Phase 1: Loop Scaffold with Edge Reuse

- Created `_process_kind()` helper function (192 lines) handling extract → decay → merge → evict → writeback
- Moved edge building before kind loop (edges computed once per tick, reused across kinds)
- Added kind loop with `sorted(allowed_kinds)` for deterministic ordering
- Added single-kind guard: `assert len(allowed_kinds) == 1` (removed in Phase 2)
- Updated return to use `total_exchanges` accumulator
- All 11 existing tests passing (Phase 1 + Phase 2a lifecycle tests)
- Performance improved: 1.22ms @ 1000 entities (35% faster than baseline 1.88ms)

### 2. C7 Phase 2: Per-Kind Cache and Multi-Kind Ready

- Changed cache key from `adapter_id` to `(adapter_id, build_seq, kind)` for per-kind isolation
- Simplified cache validity check (build_seq in key, only check N)
- Added cache cleanup: removes stale entries when build_seq changes to prevent unbounded growth
- Removed single-kind guard assert (multi-kind now allowed)
- Added `sorted(allowed_kinds)` for deterministic processing order
- All 11 existing tests passing with per-kind cache
- Performance: 1.46ms @ 1000 entities (27% headroom under 2ms target)

### 3. Lessons Learned: Hasty Edits and Recovery

- Initial attempt at Phase 1 failed due to incomplete edits (mixed extract and edge_query sections)
- Reverted to clean state with `git restore --source=HEAD`
- Learned: Research ≠ Planning. Must map complete file structure before editing
- Created detailed implementation plan (c7_phase1_implementation_plan.md) with line numbers and exact changes
- Successfully completed Phase 1 as single disciplined edit after planning
- Process: Research → Plan → Discuss → Implement (never Research → Implement)

### 4. C7 Phase 3 Test Specification Written

- Created comprehensive test spec: `project/plans/c7_phase3_test_specification.md` (450 lines)
- Defined 6 tests for `test_gossip_multikind.py`:
  1. `test_most_recent_precedence` - version > last_tick > reliability hierarchy
  2. `test_position_value_copy` - 3-tuple exact copy, no averaging
  3. `test_predator_attenuation` - multi-hop reliability decay (0.8 → 0.64)
  4. `test_cross_kind_capacity` - predator evicted before sentiment (5x faster decay)
  5. `test_multikind_determinism` - 100 entities, 50 ticks, bit-identical
  6. `test_multikind_performance` - <2.2ms pytest, <2.0ms standalone with 2 kinds
- Shared helper functions specified: create_multikind_entities, seed_predator, seed_sentiment, build_adapter
- Each test has Given/When/Then scenarios with exact values
- Tests will initially FAIL (expected - most_recent not implemented yet)

## Current Working State

### What IS Working:

- C7 Phase 1: Loop scaffold with edge reuse, helper function, single-kind tested
- C7 Phase 2: Per-kind SoA cache with cleanup, multi-kind infrastructure ready
- All 11 existing tests passing (test_gossip.py + test_gossip_lifecycle.py)
- Edge reuse: edges built once per tick, reused across kinds
- Capacity enforcement: cross-kind deterministic eviction (already working)
- Performance: 1.46ms @ 1000 entities with 1 kind (27% headroom)
- Cache cleanup: stale entries removed when build_seq changes

### What is PARTIALLY Working:

- Multi-kind support: infrastructure ready but only ship_sentiment enabled
- Merge algorithms: version_based works, most_recent not implemented
- Position types: not detected, val array created for all kinds (needs fix)

### What is NOT Working:

- most_recent merge algorithm: not implemented (needed for predator_location)
- Position value type handling: no detection, no 3-tuple copy logic
- predator_location: not in GOSSIP_ALLOWED_KINDS yet
- Multi-kind tests: not written yet (Phase 3 next session)

### Known Issues:

- ModuleNotFoundError when running scripts directly: use `python -m scripts.filename` instead of `python scripts/filename.py`
- Per-kind cache adds ~0.2ms overhead (1.22ms → 1.46ms), within budget
- No performance regression with per-kind cache (tests pass, perf acceptable)

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Implement Phase 3: Write Multi-Kind Tests (TDD)**
   - Create `aquarium/tests/test_gossip_multikind.py`
   - Implement 4 helper functions (create_multikind_entities, seed_predator, seed_sentiment, build_adapter)
   - Write 6 tests following specification in `project/plans/c7_phase3_test_specification.md`
   - Run tests: verify they FAIL appropriately (most_recent not implemented)
   - Expected failures: most_recent uses version_based, position types create val array

2. **Implement Phase 4: Make Tests Pass**
   - Detect merge algorithm from `token_def['merge']['algorithm']`
   - Implement most_recent precedence: version > last_tick > reliability (epsilon)
   - Detect position value types from `token_def['value_type']`
   - Skip val array allocation for position kinds
   - Copy 3-tuples directly in writeback (no vector math)
   - Add `'predator_location'` to `GOSSIP_ALLOWED_KINDS` in constants.py
   - Run all 17 tests (11 existing + 6 new): verify all pass
   - Validate performance: pytest <2.2ms, standalone <2.0ms with 2 kinds

## Files Created/Modified

- `aquarium/constants.py` - GOSSIP_ALLOWED_KINDS = ['ship_sentiment'] (needs predator_location added)
- `data/knowledge/tokens.yaml` - predator_location defined (lines 48-64): value_type=position, merge=most_recent, attenuation=0.2
- `aquarium/tests/test_gossip.py` - 5 Phase 1 tests
- `aquarium/tests/test_gossip_lifecycle.py` - 6 Phase 2a lifecycle tests

## Key Insights/Learnings

### Process Discipline Prevents Errors

Session started with hasty Phase 1 implementation attempt that failed:
- Made incomplete edit (changed comment but not content)
- Created duplicate edge_query sections (lines 375 and 447)
- File corrupted with mixed extract/edge_query logic

Recovery process:
- Stopped immediately when recognized issue
- Reverted to clean HEAD with `git restore --source=HEAD`
- Created detailed written plan with exact line numbers and before/after code
- Discussed plan with Mike and SD before proceeding
- Successfully completed Phase 1 as single disciplined edit

Lesson: "Research = understand concepts. Planning = understand implementation. Only plan → code, never research → code."

### Per-Kind Cache Design

Cache key structure: `(adapter_id, build_seq, kind)`
- Each kind gets own SoA arrays (has, val, version, last_tick, reliability)
- Cache validity simplified: only check N (build_seq in key)
- Cleanup prevents unbounded growth: delete stale entries for old build_seq
- Cleanup logic: `stale_keys = [k for k in cache.keys() if k[0] == adapter_id and k[1] != build_seq]`

Performance impact: +0.24ms overhead (1.22ms → 1.46ms) for per-kind cache
- Expected: cache miss on first call per kind, hit on subsequent
- Edge reuse critical: single KD-tree query per tick regardless of kind count
- Per-kind decay/merge/writeback: ~0.1-0.2ms per kind (vectorized)

### Token Definitions Guide Implementation

From `data/knowledge/tokens.yaml`:
- `ship_sentiment`: float, version_based, attenuation=0.1, freshness_rate=0.01
- `predator_location`: position, most_recent, attenuation=0.2, freshness_rate=0.05 (5x faster decay)

Position type handling:
- `value_type: position` means 3-tuple [x, y, z]
- No val SoA array needed (stored in entity dict only)
- Copy 3-tuple directly in writeback, no vector math
- most_recent merge: copy newer value wholesale, no averaging

Merge algorithm detection:
- `token_def['merge']['algorithm']` = 'version_based' or 'most_recent'
- version_based: current implementation (version > last_tick precedence)
- most_recent: version > last_tick > reliability precedence (same but explicit)

### Test Strategy: TDD for Multi-Kind

Phase 3 writes tests BEFORE implementation (TDD):
- Tests define explicit expectations
- Initial failures guide implementation
- Clear acceptance criteria for Phase 4

Test structure:
- Single file: `test_gossip_multikind.py` (shared helpers, cohesive feature)
- 6 tests cover: precedence, position copy, attenuation, capacity, determinism, performance
- Helpers reduce duplication: create_multikind_entities, seed_predator, seed_sentiment
- Performance test uses same protocol as `perf_gossip_multi_n.py` (warmup, GC disabled, 7 runs)

## Technical Notes

### Phase 1 Structure (Current)

```
exchange_tokens():
  Setup (lines 353-370)
  Edge query (lines 375-433) - ONCE per tick
  Loop over sorted(allowed_kinds) (line 441)
    Call _process_kind() for each kind (lines 449-460)
      Extract (with per-kind cache)
      Decay (per-kind rates)
      Merge (version_based only currently)
      Staleness eviction (per-kind threshold)
      Writeback (per-kind)
  Capacity enforcement (lines 467-506) - AFTER loop, cross-kind
  Diagnostics and return (lines 511-524)

_process_kind():
  Extract with per-kind cache key (adapter_id, build_seq, kind)
  Cache cleanup on miss (delete stale entries)
  Decay using per-kind rates from token_def
  Merge using version_based (most_recent not implemented)
  Staleness eviction using per-kind threshold
  Writeback changed rows to entity.knowledge_tokens[kind]
  Return (exchanges_count, changed_rows, profile_dict)
```

### Phase 4 Implementation Checklist

**Detect merge algorithm:**
```python
merge_algo = token_def.get('merge', {}).get('algorithm', 'version_based')
if merge_algo == 'most_recent':
    # Precedence: version > last_tick > reliability (epsilon)
    mask_push = has[edge_a] & (
        ~has[edge_b] |
        (version[edge_a] > version[edge_b] + epsilon) |
        ((version[edge_a] == version[edge_b]) & (last_tick[edge_a] > last_tick[edge_b] + epsilon)) |
        ((version[edge_a] == version[edge_b]) & (last_tick[edge_a] == last_tick[edge_b]) & (reliability_current[edge_a] > reliability_current[edge_b] + epsilon))
    )
```

**Detect position types:**
```python
value_type = token_def.get('value_type', 'float')
is_position = (value_type == 'position')

if is_position:
    val = None  # Don't allocate SoA array
else:
    val = np.zeros(N, dtype=np.float64)
```

**Position writeback:**
```python
if is_position:
    # Copy 3-tuple from source entity dict
    source_value = source_entity.knowledge_tokens[kind]['value']
    entity.knowledge_tokens[kind]['value'] = list(source_value)
else:
    # Scalar value from SoA array
    entity.knowledge_tokens[kind]['value'] = float(val[row])
```

**Enable predator_location:**
```python
# In aquarium/constants.py, line 87
GOSSIP_ALLOWED_KINDS = ['ship_sentiment', 'predator_location']
```

### Performance Budget (C7 Complete)

Phase 1 baseline: 1.88ms @ 1000 entities (Session 013)
Phase 1 refactor: 1.22ms @ 1000 entities (35% improvement)
Phase 2 per-kind cache: 1.46ms @ 1000 entities (+0.24ms overhead, 27% headroom)

Target with 2 kinds: <2.0ms standalone, <2.2ms pytest

Expected breakdown:
- Edge query: 0.6ms (once per call, reused)
- Per-kind processing: ~0.9ms per kind
  - Extract: 0.3ms (cache hit)
  - Decay: 0.1ms (vectorized)
  - Merge: 0.3ms (vectorized)
  - Writeback: 0.2ms
- Two kinds: 0.6 + 2*0.9 = 2.4ms (tight but achievable with cache hits)
- Capacity enforcement: 0.05ms (rarely triggers)

Optimization critical: cache hit rate must be near 100% after warmup

## Progress Metrics

- C7 Phases Complete: Phase 1 and Phase 2 (2/4)
- Next: Phase 3 (tests) and Phase 4 (implementation)
- Tests Passing: 11/11 existing tests
- Performance: 1.46ms @ 1000 entities (27% under 2ms target)
- Context Window at Handoff: 67%
