# Tube Forest - Sessile filter feeder (MVP stub)

species_id: sp-002-tube-forest
name: Tube Forest
description: >
  Sessile chemosynthetic organisms growing in clusters near hydrothermal vents.
  Cylindrical tubes 3-8 meters tall, filter organic matter from water column.
  Form dense forests providing habitat structure for mobile species.
