# Shadow - Large predator (MVP stub)
# Minimal behavior for MVP: territorial patrolling, no active hunting yet

species_id: sp-003-shadow
name: Shadow
description: >
  Large predatory organism, 8-12 meters in length.
  Thermal signature suggests endothermic physiology (rare in Titan's ocean).
  Avoids light, territorial near thermal vents.
  Player encounters have been aggressive but not sustained.
